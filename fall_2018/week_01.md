## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I was mainly looking through possible research materials. We figured out what what we wanted to implement, and more websites that could be useful. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week, we'll most likely continue finalizing our design decisions, as well as potentially begin coding the OS.

## Anything Blocking?

> There's a lot of confusion on how to approach the subject. Creating an operating system is an ambitious project to be sure, and there's a very large area where we can potentially start. We also have some issues with the technology and languages needed to create one, as none of us are masters at C or assembly, although we all do have some degree of experience.

## Notes
