## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I did end up using BIOS for my bootloader. The most significant thing I've done this week is that I've successfully managed to boot out of real mode into 32-bit protected mode. It's a decent success, and there's a nice chunk of assembly in the codebase now.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on creating a Makefile so that writing assembly will no longer be necessary. Instead, we can just write C code and compile it directly to assembly for usage in the OS.

## Anything Blocking?

> The thing that's exclusively blocking me is time. I have so little of it, but I have just enough to do what I want. The struggle now is updating the rest of my team members up to my status so we can start working properly on the project (like actual code instead of research / design).
