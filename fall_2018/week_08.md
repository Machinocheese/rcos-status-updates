## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, BASA presented our project along with a demo for the RCOS presentation. I've also successfully managed to compile from C into kernel code and to actually boot the code, so that's a success. I've also taken a look over reading in input and printing properly to the new screen.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on finishing up the designs for the keyboard driver and seeing how close I can get to reading input properly and displaying it. The final goal is ultimately something like an echo driver.

## Anything Blocking?

> The thing that's exclusively blocking me is time. I have so little of it, but I have just enough to do what I want. The struggle now is updating the rest of my team members up to my status so we can start working properly on the project (like actual code instead of research / design).

## Notes
