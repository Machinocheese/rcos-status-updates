## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I didn't do much but continue my designs on the keyboard driver. I was largely preoccupied with Thanksgiving.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on continuing my driver. I haven't found enough evidence to prove that it isn't necessary, so I'll most likely continue doing that. I'll also continue looking at custom print functions.

## Anything Blocking?

> The thing that's exclusively blocking me is time. I have so little of it, but I have just enough to do what I want. The struggle now is updating the rest of my team members up to my status so we can start working properly on the project (like actual code instead of research / design).

## Notes
