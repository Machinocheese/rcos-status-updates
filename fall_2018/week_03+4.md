## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've personally begun looking at some smaller things first, rather than jumping straight into building an OS. I've recently started looking into bootloaders and tools like qemu and nasm, and I think I'm going to get more familiar with the inner workings of it. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on continuing my research and exploring further possibilites on what I can do with bootloaders. I"m then going to see how I can then extend my new knowledge into operating systems.

## Anything Blocking?

> Well, there's obviously the knowledge block that still exists with constructing what we want. However, time now also seems to be an issue. Especially this week, when I couldn't do as much as I wanted.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
