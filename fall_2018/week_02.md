## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I didn't do too much as it was test week for me. I spent most of my time studying for classes and doing homework, and didn't have much time for much else. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week, we'll most likely continue finalizing our design decisions, as well as potentially begin coding the OS. I also plan on setting up the dev environment properly this week, but I might encounter some issues with that as well.

## Anything Blocking?

> Well, there's obviously the knowledge block that still exists with constructing what we want. However, time now also seems to be an issue. Especially this week, when I couldn't do as much as I wanted.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
