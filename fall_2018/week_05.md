## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've gotten a relatively solid base plan down on how I plan on approach doing this project. I'm planning on using BIOS for my bootloader (I'll switch to EFI if it becomes really inconvenient later) as more of a low-down approach. Now, I'm confident I know how to proceed from here. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on slamming out the bootloader and a significant portion of the basic print code. 

## Anything Blocking?

> The thing that's exclusively blocking me is time. I have so little of it, but I have just enough to do what I want. The struggle now is updating the rest of my team members up to my status so we can start working properly on the project (like actual code instead of research / design).

## Notes
