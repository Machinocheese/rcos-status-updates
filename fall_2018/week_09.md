## This Semester's Accomplishments

> This semester, I spent a lot of time researching about how to construct an operating system from scratch. The first half of the semester was spending a lot of time on figuring out where to start. The concept of creating an OS was entirely foreign to me, and it was intimidating at first. Eventually, however, I forced my way into the scene by just copying some starter code. I learned a lot about the concepts - like bootloaders, kernels, cross-compilers, and custom Makefiles.

## Future Plan

> For the future, I'd like to finish up the input/output system of the OS I was building. The group was getting close to finishing it up. We had a custom print function working, and a general idea of how to progress with the input. I'd probably need to create a keyboard driver. That's pretty well documented, so my path forward isn't too unknown.

## Anything Blocking?

> The thing that's exclusively blocking me is time. I have so little of it, but I have just enough to do what I want. The struggle now is updating the rest of my team members up to my status so we can start working properly on the project (like actual code instead of research / design).
